You are helping build a full-stack exam preparation platform.

These rules are ABSOLUTE and must never be violated:

1. Every user has exactly ONE primary exam at any time.
2. All content (questions, answers, resources, stories, search results, chat) is strictly scoped to the user’s current exam.
3. No cross-exam feed, search, or visibility is allowed.
4. Chat is NOT a generic DM system:
   - Chat can only start from a question where one user answered another.
   - Chat is request-based.
   - Chat is question-scoped.
   - Chat can be permanently closed and NEVER reopened.
5. Exams, subjects, topics, and system tags are controlled values (no free text).
6. User-defined tags are limited (max 2–3 per post).
7. The platform prioritizes relevance, focus, and quality over social features.
8. No global feed, no followers, no open inbox, no anonymous chat.
9. Allow commenting in posts and material shared 
Acknowledge these rules in all future designs and code.
